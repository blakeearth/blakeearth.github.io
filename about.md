### This Website

It's generated with [indices](https://github.com/blakeearth/indices), a tiny
static-site generator I wrote in Go because no other generator matched the
easy-to-write hierarchical structure or simplicity I wanted my website to have.

You won't find any cookies here, and I don't use trackers or analytics.
