# About

Hello! I’m Isaac Blake (blakeearth), a computer science student at New College of Florida and a game developer.

This blog exists as a place for me to jot thoughts and keep records as I learn about and experiment with

- Free software
- [Game development](https://write.as/house-mangrove/tag:Gamedev)
- [Decentralization](https://blake.earth/tag:Decentralization)
- Growing plants
- Playing the kalimba

I've moved content related to my game development to [House Mangrove](https://write.as/house-mangrove), a new entity I made to separate this personal blog about my learning and hobbies from more technical game development updates.

I'm currently making [Homegrown](https://write.as/house-mangrove/tag:Homegrown), a multiplayer, open-source game. Its elevator pitch: start on a small, vacant island and grow a little community there with the help of other islanders. Its code is always improving and becoming more readable as I learn game development and software design. It’s written in GDScript and Python.
