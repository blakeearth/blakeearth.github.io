# Homegrown

A work in progress, Homegrown is an open-source game I’m building in the Godot Game Engine. The central idea: start on a small, vacant island and grow a little community there. Its codebase is always improving and becoming more readable as I learn. It’s written in GDScript, a language similar to Python.
