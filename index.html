				<h1>Isaac Blake</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m Isaac Blake (blakeearth). I love learning about programming, games, and teamwork and sharing that knowledge as impactfully as I can. I&rsquo;m excited to work with a team to develops high-quality, maintainable software that surpasses expectations. I enjoy thinking about how best to communicate complex topics, so I have been fortunate to serve as a peer tutor of object-oriented programming concepts, where I designed and presented tailored lesson plans during the ongoing pandemic. In addition to creating and teaching several <a href="https://innkeepergames.com/classes">online game development classes</a> with over 1,500 students, I&rsquo;m currently working on a comfy and gamified productivity tool called <a href="https://innkeepergames.com/tag:SlumberPartyio">Slumber Party</a>.</p>
