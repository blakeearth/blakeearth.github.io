# Isaac Blake\
I'm Isaac Blake (blakeearth). I love learning about programming, games, and teamwork and sharing that knowledge as impactfully as I can. I'm excited to work with a team to develops high-quality, maintainable software that surpasses expectations. I enjoy thinking about how best to communicate complex topics, so I have been fortunate to serve as a peer tutor of object-oriented programming concepts, where I designed and presented tailored lesson plans during the ongoing pandemic. In addition to creating and teaching several [online game development classes](https://innkeepergames.com/classes) with over 1,500 students, I'm currently working on a comfy and gamified productivity tool called [Slumber Party](https://innkeepergames.com/tag:SlumberPartyio).
