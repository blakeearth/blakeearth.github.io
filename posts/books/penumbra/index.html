				<h1>Mr. Penumbra&rsquo;s 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan</h1>

<p>My grandma recommended this book to me after she borrowed it from a friend
of hers. She told me it had lots of references to coding and technologies
she didn&rsquo;t understand, but she said I might enjoy it. I did, thoroughly.
With qualitative depictions of programming languages like Ruby, websites
like Hacker News, and a web designer for a main character,
the book is a testament to Sloan&rsquo;s knowledge of hacker
culture during the recession. My own limited knowledge cannot vet all of it,
but the parts I knew felt authentic and fun. It was thrilling to read such
a well-researched novel, and for me, its accuracy was its biggest draw.</p>

<p>The plot was generally enjoyable but sometimes felt slow-moving and
predictable (sometimes Sloan drops just a few too many hints). Additionally,
although the book sometimes reads like a mystery or detective novel, (and
this might be minor spoiler, so beware), it isn&rsquo;t totally possible to
predict the ending. While I could predict what story&rsquo;s big resolution would
be, I could not have predicted the all-important details of the resolution.
This (minor) <em>deus ex machina</em> frustrated me, and I felt a little
cheated. After the main resolution, the rest of the story falls into
place predictably.</p>

<p>Overall, this novel is a fun and easy read, and its biggest merit is how
well-researched its technology is and how relatable the main character can
feel. I haven&rsquo;t read another book that so accurately depicts hacker culture,
so I am looking forward to reading Sloan&rsquo;s other novel in the same universe.</p>
