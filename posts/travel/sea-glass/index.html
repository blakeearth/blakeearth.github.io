				<h1>Looking for Sea Glass on a Tidal Sandbar</h1>

<p><em>Written August 7, 2019</em><br />
In an early cloudy August afternoon, my family and I walked to the tip of Great Diamond Island, where we&rsquo;re staying for a few days. At high tide, Little Diamond Island is visible across a stretch of blue-green water, with just the thin ends of grass blades breaking the surface. But when we arrived at the shore, low tide was just an hour past.</p>

<p>Between late-1800s-era houses, flowing grass and bright wildflowers, we approached the narrow, muddy sandbar connecting the two islands. Cross-island joggers passed us as we strolled along the sandbar, our voices loud and our eyes turned down. The mud was laden with snail shells, clam shells, and barnacle-covered rocks and bricks. We chatted over little fish (were they minnows or tadpoles?) darting around in tide pools. We were probably all wrong; both only live in freshwater, not the saltwater of Casco Bay.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Cotton picked up a frosted fragment of glass. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true sea glass yet, but give it another four or five years.&rdquo; And so began my little hunt.</p>

<p>We circled the sandbar, the cool summer breeze carrying mist to our cheeks. We talked, but we didn&rsquo;t make eye contact: our eyes were on the almost-repeating pattern of shells, rocks, and brick crunching at our feet. Occasionally, we&rsquo;d spot a glimmer, a shard of glass or shell we&rsquo;d bring to our faces for examination, and occasionally, the fragment would meet our standards for &ldquo;sea glass&rdquo;&ndash;rounded edges, frosted, smooth&ndash;with bonus points if the piece had an embossed word or had a rarer color, like a pastel pink or aquamarine.</p>

<p>We filled an hour this way before ending our search to head back to Great Diamond Island, and I don&rsquo;t think we could have stayed much longer. As we reached the end of the sandbar, our feet brushed through a refreshingly chilly, ever-deepening current racing across the shoal.</p>
