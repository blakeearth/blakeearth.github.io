# Song Lyric Status
I like to take song lyrics as statuses. They help me sum up how I'm feeling over a few days or weeks while sharing music.

## Current Status
- 🍃 *Bad ideas, ay / I know where they lead*
	- Set 8/24/19, Tessa Violet's "Bad Ideas"

## Past Statuses
1. 🕊️ *Handmade Heaven*
	- Set 2/9/19, Marina's "Handmade Heaven"
2. ⏳ *Backup makeshift life*
	- Imogen Heap's "Wait it Out"
3. 🌳 *Forming empires in the shade of trees*
	- Lights's "Running with the Boys" (*Midnight Machines* version)

I didn't log all of them when I was first starting to do this, so I might have missed some and don't have the dates of some others.
